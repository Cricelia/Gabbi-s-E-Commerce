# Gabbi-s-E-Commerce

# Project Description
This capstone is an e-commerce application (online store) for a company named EasyShop.
The website uses a Spring Boot API project for the backend server, with a MySQL database for
data storage. I was provided with existing code, including a database script that defined the 
initial data struture.My main task was to make improvements and updates to the API. I used 
Postman extensively to test my endpoints and ensure the logic worked as expected. There's also
a front-end website included in the starter code, which I used to verify that the API correctly 
supports the user interface and overall functionality.

# Application Requirements
Version 1 of this website allows users to browse products in various categories, 
add them to a shopping cart and check out to order the products. All of the 
features of the UI are fully functional. The changes and development will only 
need to be done in the backend Spring Boot Java API project. 
The existing API code includes: 
• user registration and login 
• the ability to display products by category 
• search for or filter the products list.
